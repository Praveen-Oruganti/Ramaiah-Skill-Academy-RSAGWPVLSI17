## File 1:Plot Random numbers
File name:plot_random.m
This code generates two distinct plots using randomly generated data. First, it prompts the user to input a limit, which defines the range for the x-axis. The y-values are randomly generated integers between 1 and 15. A line plot with markers is created in the left subplot, labeled "Approach One," showcasing the relationship between the x-values and y-values. In the second subplot, labeled "Approach Two," another set of x and y values is randomly generated, this time within the range of 1 to 6. Both plots feature line styles with circular markers and have axes labeled accordingly. The overall structure allows for visual comparison of two different approaches using randomly generated data sets.
